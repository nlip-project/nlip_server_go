1) NLIP executable should be moved to /usr/local/bin/nlip for the Launch Daemon to successfully run it upon boot.
   Druid has a launch service configuration (.plist) that runs the nlip executable there on boot and automatically restarts on failure.
   The script located at scripts/deploy.sh automates the deployment process for a MacOS machine, Druid, at University of Michigan.
2) Likewise, there must be a .env file located in the root of the project. Then, after running the scripts/deploy.sh from the root.
   it will read the .env file and make all the variables there globally available for the program to run correctly. The environment
   variables there are imperative for the Auth functionality to work.
3) For this implementation to work, a OAUTH 2.0 server must be running on localhost:8080!
   The handler functions assume that.
